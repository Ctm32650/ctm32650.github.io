			In one of the fastest growing industries in the world, Esports, holds a substantial <i>$138 billion dollar</i> market value according to Newzoo.
			<a HREF="https://www.investopedia.com/news/booming-esports-industry-hit-138b-2018/">Investopedia</a> further states this industry holds a insane 13.3% market growth within just one year.
			The development and quite frankly absurd growth this industry can all be linked back towards one game in particular,League of Legends. League of legends is a
			MOBA(massive online battle arena)based game. League of Legends(LOL) is the most widely played game in the world with active users reaching over 60 million players in recent years.
			A massive hit in most Asian countries and substantial growth in the west, Riot Games, founders of LOL have invested millions of dollars into creating an international
			icon in the gaming world. They have pushed to develop a new scene "E-sports" within the athletic world. With investors including NBA teams and Large corporations like Mastercard,
			League of Legends as since become the forefather of this Rocketing new market.

			Since the widespread growth of LOL new games have soon taken an attempt to develop their own version of competitive gaming. 
			Blizzard's hit game "Overwatch" now holds a <a href="https://www.invenglobal.com/overwatch/articles/2335/blizzards-20-million-dollar-overwatch-league-finds-six-major-buy-ins"><b>$20 million dollar</b></a> buy in
			to even hold a competitive team within their league. With time and the success of these two huge markets more and more games have since dibbed their toes into development of a competitive
			scene for their games. Fortnite, PUBG, Call of Duty, etc have all invested massive amounts of money into developing and furthering their "scenes".
			Gaming companies are swiftly realizing the potential dollar signs that come from creating a competitive aspect to their game that allows fans and users to gain new levels of aspiration to develop their skills within that particular game.
			</p>

		<p>
			One of the biggest and most influential developing markets of its time, <b>Esports</b>, should be on everyone's watch list. Within the coming years
			we will only see a further growth in the industries as more and more companies and large investments firms are realizing 
			the absolute potential and future of this upcoming market.
